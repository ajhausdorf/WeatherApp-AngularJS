<!--  dt is passed into a function in the directive tag on forecast.htm, so it reqires an object map {dt: weatherDay.dt} where the first dt is the variable passed into the directive's html tag, and the second is it's JSON attribute -->
		
<!--  the object called (weatherResult in forecastController) & (w in the ng-repeat on forecast.html) is poked into the directive's scope as weatherDay: '=' (two way binding).  so, we need to use weatherDay to call it here  -->
